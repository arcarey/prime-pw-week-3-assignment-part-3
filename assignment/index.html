        <li>When I was looking at some non-prime resources on 'for of' loops, it declares the iterating variable using const or let, but our videos do not declare the variables, it just assigns a value. 
          It seems that both work, but declaring the variable would throw an error if you accidentally resued a variable already delared in the global scope. 
          Is it seen as a 'best practice' to use let or const in those for loops, or would it be considered unnecessary clutter, or less readable code to use a declaritive every time?
